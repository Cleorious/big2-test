TODOS:

Optimization
-check the card back shader to only display sprites from front
-atlas sprites to optimize draw calls

FEATURES
GAME LOOP WITH FSM
BOT AI 
All common Big 2 rules are well implemented.

Can choose a character at the beginning. Character avatars can change depending on
the game condition during gameplay. For example, when winning the character is
smiling, while when losing the character looks sad / angry.

● 2D / 3D choice is purely optional. Priority is on the gameplay aspect of the game, not
graphics quality. Using any 3rd party graphic & sound assets are OK.

● As the game is 4 players, the other 3 players would be run by AI.

● Can use any framework / plugins in Unity to ease the development process. But MUST
NOT use any Big 2 game templates.

Use of pooling for spawned objects.
● Finite State Machine to control player state (e.g. start, running, die) and game state (e.g.
ready, game run, game end).
● Demonstrates usage of common Design Pattern (singleton, factory, observer,
etc.).
● Basic AI design.
● Collision / colliders if necessary.
● C# Event and Delegate usage inside the game. Or even better, show usage of UniRX /
Reactive programming.
● Correct usage of coroutine.
● Dependency Injection / Entity Component System implementation.
● Usage of UI framework (Unity UI or other framework is OK).
● Git as source control.
● Assets and performance optimization.
